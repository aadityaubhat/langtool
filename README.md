# üõ†Ô∏è LangTool

LangTool is a Python library designed to enable seamless interactions between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Python functions and classes. The primary objective of LangTool is to facilitate the creation of user-friendly LLM tools for Python functions and classes. To achieve this, LangTool introduces Toolify, a class that adds a semantic layer on top of functions or classes.

LangTool borrows the concept of a Tool from LangChain (https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain). One of the goals of this project is to complement LangChain by providing a high-level interface for users to create tools on the fly.

## üìù Example Usage

``` python
from langtool import Openai, Toolify, Model

def get_headlines(topic, date, language='EN', n=100):
    """
    Function to fetch headlines based on a given topic, date, and language.
    
    Args:
    topic (str): The topic for which headlines should be fetched.
    date (str): The date (YYYY-MM-DD) on which the headlines were published.
    language (str, optional): The language in which the headlines should be returned. Defaults to 'EN' (English).
    n (int, optional): The number of headlines to fetch. Defaults to 100.

    Returns:
    list: A list of headlines (strings) based on the specified topic, date, and language.
    """
    return ['']

llm = Openai('<OpenAI_API_KEY>', Model.GPT_4)
headlines_tool = Toolify(get_headlines, llm)

print(headlines_tool.run('Get headlines about Twitter as of yesterday'))
# Output 
# get_headlines('Twitter', '2023-04-18') 
```

## üì¶ Installation

```python
pip install langtool
```

## üìç Roadmap

- [ ] Support creating LangChain tools
- [ ] Support Python modules as tools
- [ ] Support external APIs as tools
- [ ] Support Toolkits consisting of multiple tools
- [ ] Support other LLMs
